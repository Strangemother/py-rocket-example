    Sector 40. Look, let's record like 9 - then you ca... NO - I'm a human! [narrator loses an off mic argument] ... FUCKING MACHINES! SECTOR 77!

Narrator fades out as if leaving the sound booth:

    No I've had it! Get someone else! I'm not doing any more of these FUCKING SECTORS! FUCK sectors, fuck gecko, [new male voice] [clear throat] Sector Candle Candle Epsilon.
