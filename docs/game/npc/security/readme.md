All outdoor traveling scenarios are governed by officer rule. Citizen rule is strict and it's easy to annoy the security personnel.

    Stop citizen, this is security official. Your termination is deemed cost effective. Comply or we will utilise our budget.


## Utterly Nutty Police

The security details in the world will be unhinged; garnered through their superiority over the standard citizen and rights applied to One Corp.

They're overzealous overplayed version of a terrible officer officer; with reduced power but inflated ego and an unhinged attitude - and the law allowed right to kill occupants of a vehicle.

This entire state is done for comedic effect. A screaming insane security officer is more fun than a similarly actioned (but quieter) npc. They should scream fun insanities. Potentially swear or yell (seemly) unexpected content.
