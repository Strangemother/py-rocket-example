The user visits the Junkyard bot

When the user records their name, it actually records static snow.

The junkyard bot looks like crap such as a metal stick with two paper eyes. when asked about its appearance the robot is defensive, citing bad game developers.


PLY: "Hello my name is [static snow]"
NPC: "Well hello there Kevin.."
PLY: "... That's not my name..."
NPC: "Sure but I'm only programmed with one name..."
NPC: "Come-on Placeholder, I'll show you around..."

If the user approaches the bot and touches it - the paper eyes fall off. The bot exclaims: "Those are my eyes you piece of shit Placeholder."
