# First vehicle

The 'first vehicle' will be a user freebie. This isn't the game-rails "intro vehicle" - of which is very advanced - the first vehicle defines the initial player owned vehicle, complete with broken parts and a ready flight system.

The ethos of the game is to own and run the vehicle. Thus the first vehicle is a true junker, given to the player by the junk yard. It'll be repaired with items collected by the player and installed at-will.

+ The 'lando cruiser' style vehicle seems applicable.
+ The player will accept and fly to their home pod.
+ The vehicle will be mostly broken
+ It wont fly very far initially limiting the player distant.
+ Broken advert machine


## Cables

Most of the repairs should be done through recabling, software, and hardware installs. The player will navigate their inner ship and work upon element. The game goal should be player editing; rerouting 'wires' and testing their rig.


### Initial breaks

The first wires should be placed in a location where the user 'breaks' the connection - such as across a doorway or on the floor. This may be superficial to severe requiring the player to perform a number of fixes before the vehicle can start.

idea

The player may have a destructive weapon and allowed to fit it to their new vehicle, however discharging the weapon within the ship will cause a fault.

The fault manifests through the framework, in-game the user will need to phyically repair the broken items.
