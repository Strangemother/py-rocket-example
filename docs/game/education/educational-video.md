    What are the ABC's of atomicly infused vector engines?


    A is for Atom
    B is for Bimolecular flux invariance
    C is for the Charge Induced over a palladium infused super fluid array

    What's the result?

    D! For Directly injected capacitance


    Why do we need this? And how does it affect us in our hussle and bussle lives.

    Let's start by meeting a leading authority on the subject, Professor Belmanning Von Karlman [German American Name], and watch him in action (secretly) solving one of the core problems in his day.

    What would happen if your reduced the charge capacitance through a fluid array during it's phased change state?

    [chuckle] Well, this may seem pretty simple now, but back then, scientists did now know, nor know _how_ to know, what are the core fundamentals of flux invariance where.

    Today, we know is simply as The vector jet. And have at least one for ever person in the US. Even if you don't know it by its scientific name, The vector jet or manages your day in more way that you can possibly imagine.
