# Skyway Laws

1. Any Vehicle is property of one-corp (when requested), and thus the occupants within, whilst travelling.
2. "Police" are reduced, "one corp security" are overlords


## Lightway


Tubes of travel through the skyway, without a _real_ road - but with the hovering responses of a surface. Users may opt to leave the lightway, using more power to stay afloat.

When on the lightway the _rail_ has a pseudo floor - of which engines will repulse. A user could fall through the lightway rail floor by powering down and leave by powering up.

Lightways connect to physical junctions of roads - the general skyway entrances and on/off-ramps.
