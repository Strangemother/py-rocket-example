# Skyway Laws

1. Any Vehicle is property of one-corp (when requested), and thus the occupants within, whilst travelling.
2. "Police" are reduced, "one corp security" are overlords


## Lightway


Tubes of travel through the skyway, without a _real_ road - but with the hovering responses of a surface. Users may opt to leave the lightway, using more power to stay afloat.

When on the lightway the _rail_ has a pseudo floor - of which engines will repulse. A user could fall through the lightway rail floor by powering down and leave by powering up.

---

Lightways connect to physical junctions of roads - the general skyway entrances and on/off-ramps.

Entering a flight portal, reseeds the planetary item; within the environment relative to the height.
For example, heading into a 'red' portal, would produce the 'hover city' layout in a 'fog environment' -
Heading into a light portal, switches the _current_ spawned arena into a _blue/white_ environment.

Other colors such as red, (flipped worlds?), black (Horror black metal), gray (fog nuclear) blue (eutopia)

## Turbo-way

A Skyway built for very large vehicles travelling very quickly.

+ The turbo-way enforces a forward motion through the tube.
+ The system should have a turbo navigator to calculate the vector of each junction
    + IF the user does not have the TN, they may type in the junction paths manually
      in a mini game, attempting to type commands into the turboway
    + If fail, the user drops out of hyperspeed, beneath the travelling vehicles

Traveling on the turbo-way will act more like _on rails_. With the correct system tools,
the user may not interact with the travel; picking a desination and watching the ride.



## Weapon

A 'vector z flattener'. Shooting at an enemy flattens them as a decal projected onto the background envionment,
3d rendered relative to the users position. The enemy is suck in that 2d Projection.



## Giant Enemy

A 'boss' is a giant "heavy metal" robot. Who talks in heavy metal music, and when
damaged switches to "dark metal" mode.

    PL: OMG computer what the hell is that?
    AI: It's Rashshakhan!! Named thusly for he found it heavy metal scary.
    PL: My weapons are useless - what's it made of!
    AI: Atomically condensed fortified carbide tungsten. Seriously Heavy Metal...
