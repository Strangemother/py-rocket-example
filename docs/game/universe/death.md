A Player death is a reset to a safe point or a mission start point.

When a player dies, they should see a 'death scene' complete with flashbacks, voives and "lights out".


+ Hear a deep warm voice after death, telling Tommy it's not his time - and zapped back
+ Death by heazy lazer results in lazer spots on the camera through a fading scene
+ Or my personal favourite, _instant black_ - where the player had a fast death; the scene should black silence - music, ship, narrator - all of it.
    If possible, the audio machine overflow will continue and as a feedback loop
