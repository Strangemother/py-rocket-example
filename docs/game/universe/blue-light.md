# The Blue Light

Throughout the game, many references to the blue light will be made by NPC's and script. Potentially the blue light exists in game play but the player is unaware of its purpose until the end act.

? The blue light has no real concept built for it, being mostly a humourous include for the officers. So we make one...

The blue light tell security people, "this unit is sentient and displays no ill-will". A machine that is sentient, but is not aware of the blue light, is desingated a non-sentient machine - and subject to outbursts.

Without a blue light the unit is broken, unaware, or angry. All of which are grounds for instant destruction on the guise of "human safety".

This is a catch 22, as it's not illegal to be sentient, however a sentient machine should display _it is not a threat_. If a machine does not exhibit self-aware tendencies, it's less of a threat.

Thus a sentient machine should display a blue light. George after the accident is a sentient machine, should display the blue light. However as his sentience was created during an event, he was never informed, and only realise _after_ the sucess of bringing down the government.

This action leads to the change of the blue-light making George aware.

This is why george:

+ is always approached with caution by officers
+ he has 'game' interface, can pause himself etc...
+ has narrator and AI in his head always helping him.
