In this trope

+ The game voice over _knows they are a voice over_ for both edu and narrator but never breaks character
+ Lady VO is eventually a normal person - not just a voice over.
+ The VO can break the 4th wall (but not character unless scripted)
+ The VO can talk directly to the player
+ And about the player to themselves and other VO.

+ The player may reference they are in a game, but never actuate or realise the statement
