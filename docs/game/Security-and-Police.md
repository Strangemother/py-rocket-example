> Stop citizen, this is the police. Your termination is deemed cost effective. Comply or we will utilise our budget.


## Utterly Nutty Police

The security details in the world will be unhinged; garnered through their superiority over the standard citizen and rights applied to One Corp.

They're overzealous overplayed version of a terrible police officer; with reduced power but inflated ego and an unhinged attitude.

This entire state is done for comedic effect. A screaming insane security officer is more fun than a similarly actioned (but quieter) npc.

They should scream fun insanities. Potentially swear or yell (seemly) unexpected content:


For example no swearing until a sincere insult:

> FOR THE LOVE OF CRACK ADDICT MONKIES SHOW US YOUR GOSH FUDGING TENTICLES YOU SPACE FRACKING HARLET SHIT!


Pointing a weapon at the player:

> AAAARGHHH DO IT - !LIE DOWN DO IT DO IT! LIE DOWN AND REMOVE THE ABSRASIVE MAXUTROPIC. DO IT AAAAARGGH DO THE THING I SAID MOTHER HUBBING IMMEDIATELY AAARRRGGH

> DO WHAT WE SAY - DO IT ALL RIGHT NOW! DO IT ALL OR WE'LL KILL A PUPPY YOU SHIT. WE'LL KILL THIS GOD DAMN PUPPY BUNNY YOU HATER!
