+ The last scene, (after success), george shuts off the TV Screen and goes out to play.

+ The voiceover man was Georges father, at the last scene we hear him call from the background
+ The voiceover woman was Georges mother, at last scene she calls him away from the screen.


George is the character he just played within the game, and is "little Tommy" from the initial inventors scene. Throughout the game, the references to George the character - was in fact the child playing.


## Out-game scene

We assume final in-game success, with the finished screen loading out, and zooming the camera out - looking at the TV Screen we just looked at. The tv screen flits from end game scene, to a snow, then off. George has done this in response to his mothers request. Of which was _Nicole_, asking George to leave the TV and go outside.


+ The sound is echoy (dream-like), as we zoom out we hear mother clearer.
+ The scene is true 50's
+ Maybe black-and-white
+ With a lauging track
+ Such that, George (out-game) is a child in a 50's scene - this is a TV scene the player was watching.


Scene: Exit game scene, viewing a 'vista'. In the background we hear female AI:

    [from chatter] ... And sure we'd need to turn off the box...
    But I don't think it'll be a problem...

    Okay George, let's turn off that box ...

Transition starts.

    Let's turn off that game george ..

    [dream echos] George ?..

    George? ...

    Are you listening son, I have ice-cream? [unintelligable]

scene transitions into looking at the out-game TV.

Mother:

    [focus sound in quickly]

    ... Now come-on George, turn off that box and go outside to play. You'll never learn at that new-fangled electronic contraption

George sighs and switches off the TV

dad:
    George, comeon, come help me on the car

george:

    Does it fly yet dad?

dad:
    [chuckles] No not yet, but you promised you'll invent it.

george:

    I did Dad!! look!
    [pulls out floating glowing orb]

dad:

    Wooh what the fuck is that George

mother:

    JERRY! LANGUAGE
