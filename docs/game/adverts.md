# Game Advert

During play the user will receive "adverts" piped through a media player within the player vehicle. As a user travels past a point of interest, the game-ad will play on the ad-screen.

The general theme is atompunk/solarpunk with a hint of distopian overlords (the one corp company).


The in-game _tone_ would focus on fun interactions with a tongue in cheek overture. As a whole the NPC's act neutral unless scripted; such as the "junkyard owner". The in-game world has _advertisements_ for upgrades and world scenes. Automatic adverts popup on a ships "externals coms panel" as audio, video, (or hologram?) auto-play whilst flying past.

the advert is almost nialist in a post apocalyptic manner, with a conversely happy tone, conveying wacky products.

_Note these are not final - but more a reference to tone_


+ "Buy Buy BUY Ship Insurance for your Ships Insurance; Garmented to Pay Pay Pay Twice!"

+ "The One Corp. We own it all - so you don't have to..."

+ "Need spare oxygen but don't have Respiratory Insurance Insurance? Swap your Respiratory Insurance for one other limb and get Lungs for free! ^This does not include replacement respiratory insurance or validate a new respiratory insurance insurance."

+ "Do you enjoy overindulging on One Corp One entrenchment process once a day, but don't have victims? Look for the swan acre sky exit holo-offer available within [crazy math] minus one half tan over vector one comma three zero Asimuth! Or simply dial F dollar four eplison into your One Device!"

+ "Bored of working 4 hours a day 4 days a week?! Become a Human Interaction Drone for less!" [Graphic of a (oddly) happy human pressing a single button for 4 hours in a 5 second timelapse]

+ "Robot Pet Surprise, for when you need an exact replacement of your catalyst depleted pet. ^Consciousness safely stored in the pet paradise for 6 months then kindly recycled. All proceeds are collected by the one corp."


+ Woops! It looks like your proximity to a One Corp owned location has tripped the One Corp Safe Mesh security perimeter.

 Please power down your vehicle and wait silently until a One Corp Automated Security Detail attends your location to gently collect your vehicle and kindly terminate all current occupants. And don't worry! All collected assets will be used for your One Corp Detention Fee.

An initial flight into the main game (city?) should play a welcome message.
