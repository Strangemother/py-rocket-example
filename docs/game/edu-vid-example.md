The general sound effect (low bitrate, slight hiss minimal bass, popped treble)
will be applied through the procedural audio engine, when played a the user. The raw file should be _relatively_ clean; however too clean will persist into the audio stream.
It's recommended the base audio file is set to a 16bit samples, and further (marginally) down-sampled within the audio engine, with concatenated foliage.

This may prove difficult for the voice actors, as replicating the _sound_ of the narrator may require a simulated booth setup. As such the raw audio file may be pre-processed inclusive of:

+ Treble accents
+ mid-tone enhancements
+ low bass


## Noted Cadence

Elements of the original style should be replicated.

+ Non-descriptive mid-American (circa 1950's) accent
+ (possible) overly clarified wording
+ emphasis _W_ - Imagine "Cool Whip." pronounced with a wispy _W_
+ Microphone peaks due to _midtone_ (No a _bass mutes_ or _treble tin_)
+ Hard phonetic _M_
+ Hard phonetic _D_ due to the audio equipment of the time
+ Long Pauses

    What are the ABC's of atomically infused vector engines?

[A good calibration sentence in relevent to the 1950's article]

    A is for Atom.

[long pauses]

    B is for Bimolecular flux invariance.

    C is for the Charge Induced over a palladium infused super fluid array.

[Question tone]

    What's the result?

[Exclaim D]

    D! For Directly injected capacitance.

    Why do we need this? And how does it affect us in our hussle and bussle lives.


    Let's start by meeting a leading authority on the subject, Professor Belmanning Von Karlman [German American Name], and watch him in action (secretly) solving one of the core problems in his day.

    What would happen if your reduced the charge capacitance through a fluid array during it's phased change state?

    [chuckle] Well, this may seem pretty simple now, but back then, scientists did now know, nor know _how_ to know, what are the core fundamentals of flux invariance where.

    Today, we know is simply as The vector jet. And have at least one for ever person in the US. Even if you don't know it by its scientific name, The vector jet or manages your day in more way that you can possibly imagine.

    Development of space age materials with ever higher strength to weight ratios centers in the structural materials division of the Vector Jet Corporation and paved the way for..:

    + revolutionary structural materials
    + atomtronics
    + Aeronautics
    + automation

    And of course the adoption of Conformal Geometric Algebra as humanities base numerical counting system:

    + In our schools
    + In engineering
    + and through our daily lives


    Without it we wouldn't have some of the comforts we expect and enjoy today such as:
