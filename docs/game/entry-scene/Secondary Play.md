# Secondary Play

After the user completes the game (first run), they will continue into the game loop, spawning at a spot whilst chatting to AI.

Upon the second rerun - the player performs act-1 again, but knows to build their ship and fly home. At this point the ships has extra capabilities to fly futher (perhaps the moon) and the previous "ending" and victory parade wasn't the end.

In this second play the character has space play. Previously seen but unused in the game. Under no circstances was "Space" offered as a play area, with vehicles being atmosphere based. Once in space the user controls will differ, offering a new round of jobs and missions.
