In the first iteration of the game, the ad machine will be broken, causing the output to sound faulty; The user may choose to ignore to (prompted) break the device.

The Voice Over states (over the noise). The ad machine isn't functioning, a quick mend using XYZ will solve the issue - whilst a popup displays a destructive method.

    Ooh okay, your One Corp one ad device is malfunctioning; maybe you should take a look at that before it becomes too noisy for use both.

    [player hits the device]

        Seriously Kevin - don't hit the one corp one ad device.

        ...

        That won't work! That's not how making things work, works!..

    [smashed device causes silence, then a ping of agreement.]

        ... fuck off Kevin.

    [user patiently fixed the issue within the noise]

        See, Now wasn't this better than simply smashing it to immediately to fix the problem?..

    [user ignores problem]

        That's a lot of noise; It's advised you correct the fault immediately before this craft powers down and you plummet to your death -

        ...

        ... For fuck sake Kevin cut your shit. Fix the damn machine.

    [ship dies into silence]
