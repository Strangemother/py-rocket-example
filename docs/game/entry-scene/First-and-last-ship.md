# Capital Ship

When the user enters the game, they initially spawn within a "capital ship". It's likely the most advanced ship in the game. Through the game loop a user is already authenticated for any capital ship.

During the game The user will see/collect this ship, knowing the insides. For first time players they are not aware of the end-state.

---

The user can warp into space, but is limited by fuel. It'd be fun to implemented a true "stranded" routine, limiting the plays ability to warp into nowhere.

Upon first stranded moment, the AI will voice over:

    you've really fucked up now george.
    you've really screwed up now george.

    you've warped into the middle of no-where!

    What the hell do we with this situation!?
