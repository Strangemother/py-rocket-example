    [announcer] And from now on we'll all hope to have robot, human, and AI Kind living together in Peace and Harmony.
    As this Ridiciouls looking robot George has shown us - Not all AI IS EVIL!

crowd cheers

    All Hail George the SAFE sentient overlord of the New Planitia!
    George what would you like to say in front of all these billions of people?

George:

    I'm a robot?


Female Narrator:

    What?

George:

    What?

Female Narrator:

    Do you not know, you're a robot..?

George:

    ... well I err ...
    ... I mean, I had my suspicions ... but it's not like it's written any ...

Female Narrator:

    [background laughter] How could you not know you're a robot? It is literally printed on the back of your head.

George:

    It is?

Female Narrator:

    It is.

George (Georges equivalent of shock):

    Ooh.
    Explains a few things I suppose.
