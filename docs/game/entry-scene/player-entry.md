As the player enter into a environment that seems 'evil'. The sound system is playing slow-mo, the engines are broken, the lights are blinking, and surreal tones playing in the background.

The player must perform some sort of event to correct the issue - such as reenabling the system - At this point the audio corrects, emiting Nicole's Welcome and the intro track.

## Intro - Ending - Re-Intro.

AI is chatting happily about [her] new toys. Through first game play this is all noise, many languages - in final play, the user should be happy to hear AI run through a bunch of languages, welcoming the player to _their_ new Planitia.

    No fucking way George I have a quantum invariance interferometer!
    Awesome, my very own bi-lateral coulombs junctions!

    No WAY GEORGE! an anti-matter induced flux capacitor!? That's SCI-FI SHIT!!!
    What does it do!? Press it George, Press the big red button!...

on screen it says do not press. The user may opt to press, the AI will do it eventually.
Apply strong peer-pressure

    Go on George - press it... press it... Go On
    Press press press the button!..
    PRESS THE BUTTON!....

AI does it anyway

    Woops! The bu.. [wrong button clicks.]
    Woops! [pressed correct button] The button pressed...

AI Presses button, causing the ship to warp.

    [laughes] Wooh! I did not expect that. Jeesus I feel queasy.


Notice park point:

    Ooh that's almost overly convenient, can we take a break for a moment?
    We can park there [point at location].

AI Offers in-game lore toy; knowing George likes X.

    I can do it, You can go play with the new jetpack room!

Ship lands on park point.

## Ending

Given the start scene is an advanced ship the ending scene is all-out war. Followed by a victory moment. The player will succeed and venture out with a new ship, given by the new government; through a giant parade that lasted for days.

The player will eventually get into the ship, and venture off the new "New Gecko Planitia." Previously known as "Gecko Planitia". as they setoff to the [new scene or given space], a last stage _rebelion_ will attempt a fight with george in the new ship.

The fight is easy given the new automated weapons and upgrades. A final super-boss appears (again), but this time AI has a new time-warp? feature. and the player 'presses the button'. A black hole appears warping the player away, leaving super-boss in the dust.

Conversation with AI

George:

    And Jerry...

AI:

    Dead ..

George

    And Lil' timmy

AI:

    Dead.

George:

    And the bad guy with the weird background effects?

AI:

    Yup. Also Dead.

George:

    Wow [name] you've become quite the killer in your maturity.

AI [matter-of-fact tone]

    It's not my fault, they're all humans... Popped like balloons...

George:

    Ooh how awful. Did he at least die painlessly?

AI:

    Poor [bad guy], he fell off the plateu and tumbled into a fan bladed vector thruster, came out the other in shreds...

George:

    To shreds you say [tut tut tut tut]? Well, hows wife holding up..?


Ai [momentary pause]

    ... I'm not doing this bit ...

george [dejected]:

    Ooh.

### Re-intro

The intro from warp is essentially the Tramner Intro, The ship is nattering away with conviviality, and asks to take a break at the nearest re-stop as the warp jump has made her queasy...

As the player is checking out the new toys from the ship (and hopefully enoying a vista) a security officer - replay Tramner Intro scene...

---

When George wakes up - the on-screen character presents the same "memory issues", but in this case, the player has the entire backstory.

The player will hit "the long pause", but will have enough agency to fly off, plug in the directions to their new home and ask for a free ship replacement!


09-10-2021

## Tramner Intro

The player fades into the helm of an advanced ship with all the features for easy flying.
As the player is flying towards the new city, the ship asks to stop for a moment as she's not feeling well [due to some previous minor event].

The player lands the ship on a designated spot. After a moment security appears, spawning a fight scene the player will lose. The player should take control of the ship to fly away, but the first hit from the officer rendered the engine useless.

The player tumbles out the sky until the music drop [00:33] - through 20 seconds of gaining control. The AI is yelling commands, at [00:53] all hell breaks loose and AI helps.

[1:15] a chase begins, AI is asking to get higher.
[1:58] Security present a violent challenge And the player is shot out the sky for a game reset.

## Machine reset 'forgot' wake-up.

The player will wake to a (callback - red dwarf Kryten wakes after a ship disaster) screen reset and see error messages and issues to fix. At the point the player is within a torn environment, strewn with waste from the ship.

One item is functioning (audio unit) with female AI yelling instructions as the battery fades, her scream to get away. The last sounds from the machine are dark tones [the audio engine playing the same tones, through a extreme lower pitch, causing horror-like noises]. The scene environment will change signalling impending doom.

    George, get out of there!

The machine is in a lower hole, however the game hint "down here" notes she's aware of the world - down here being the nuclear floor.

    George I've not got much power down here..
    I won't be... able ...

Machine repeats

    George, get out of there!
    George, get out of there!

But finally it's not actually repeating - the ai is scared.

    Seriously George Get the fuck out...

Descend to unhinged angry

    ... Fuck this shit - Wake me when it's over!

At this stage one action occurs forcing AI to shutdown. Another long pause of utter silence - space noises.










##

In the lore; the player has lost all memory of the narrator and AI, why they act personablly and why they exist. Eventually we discover the arch story; The AI is the E8 and already knows george. The Narrator as already narrated the story - and has access to the 4th wall.

The player should fashion a ship of sorts to fly to safety prompted by new voice over (Male narrator), gently explaining the task to the audience as the player acheives.

Advanced players will be aware of this area through late stage game reveals - they will likely run off to find the nearest "special object" laying dangerously close-by. New players are unaware and will fashion the requirements from the nearby seen stuff.
