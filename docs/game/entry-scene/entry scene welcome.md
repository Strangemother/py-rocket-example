The player enters the game dramically - perhaps falling from the sky, with the fog below and the city in the distance.

The user should take control of the ship - else be reset back to the fall start. Once controlled, the player must fly to the city.

The voiceover will be chattering in spanish, maybe chinese and others until setting on one language, greeting the player by first name.

    My bad George, I'll stick to Ingl√©s from now on...

+ Through an entry sky port
+ Greeted by security

The player presents as geometric shape character. This will by for style - but the overture should present it was for cost saving during game development.

But the player discovers they are the AI software? in this geometric box;

+ hence why they don't remember anything before the event
+ They don't have a real phyical presence
+ Can become controller of many devices
+ Why one-corp can destroy the ship
+ And why the player can 'hear' the voiceover - could be one of:
    a). It's the _human_ playing the _player_ as a ship character.
    b). It's the machine with audio wifi and a friendly sentient voiceover
    c) the voiceover is aware of the world and is helping to build a free utopia.
+ And why the blue button is important
    It tells one corp this device (the player now ship) is aware - it is not sentient. All sentient robots should be destroyed.

The player, (the machine) has no memory prior to "the event". But because it's a machine - this "the event" occured some years ago. due to some physics explanation - the ship is now tumbling into the atmosphere, causing a minor repair - enabling the player.

The "event" is yet to be decided by the writer.

People are still scared since the 'event' and one corp was one of the only survivors past economical crash, and as such are a monopoly - owned by the 'bad guy'.
