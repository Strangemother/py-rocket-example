# Entry Scene

The main entry scene is also the predominant game ending; where the player has an advanced ship - it's immediately shot down and the player must reach their goal.

A general flow:

1. Fade into advanced ship with AI chattering
2. A request to land
3. during this they're attacked by officers
4. causing a losing fight.
5. Player 'wakes up' in a surreal world.
6. and run/builds to safety.

Through the game the user achieves a license to work ships, and plays the game arch. The arch ends with the massive ticker-tape parade, and swag.

continuing from above:

6. (#6) and run/builds to safety.
7. Fly to a point on the map
8. Being mission and license churn
9. discover base story
10. large events win prizes
11. Game play until the ship can boss play
12. Play boss
13. Win and ticker tape parade
14. Receive new ship being flight to a point on the map.
17. Initate Warp
18. (#1) Fade into advanced ship with AI chattering

repeats intro:

19. (aka #2) A request to land (because warp test.)
20. (aka #3) during this they're attacked by rebels
21. (aka #4) causing a losing fight.
22. (aka #5) Player 'wakes up' in the fog.
23. (aka #6) and run/builds to new home point.

---

The user flys off to the new location, with the AI chattering, they warp.
The scene fades into #1, and the loop continues. In loop 2 onward, the plater is aware of the previous events, thus the narrator, AI and current situation make-sense; as they already know the player.

In loop 2, the player knows of their landing pad and may reset their ship (insurance). In loop 1, this content may exist but unknown to the player.

## Respawn knowledge

On the respawn the same events essentially occur, but player knowledge alters the state:

1. Officer at (#3) are "rebels" of the previous win through loop 2 (#21)
2. Advanced chatter (#1\~#2), is "learning the ship" (#18..)
3. Surreal world (#5) is beneath new Planitia in (#22)
4. AI chatter through (#1), was in fact AI naming Georges new location (#18)
