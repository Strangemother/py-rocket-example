# cpu upgrade

a user start with 1Tera htz for the AdamFlightSystem.
When doubled (through) puchase. The audio doubled - enacting a 'voice' per CPU in sync.
When issues occur - one than one conversation persists from Xcpu devices.
A max of 4* voices then apply _base_ for more cpus.

A user should be able to determin the _power_ of the system by audio robotic voices.

# Engine coupling

During a game, the user may lose and engine through dogfighting or general damage. The engine may be attached by flying close-enough for the device to auto-connect.

Other users may do the same - augmenting egine theft. Any angine may persist on a vehicle - causing mismatches and interesting flying dynamics created by the user (scrap recycling)
