# Progression

The game centres around travelling within the ship. Initially the user will have some flying vehicle - but must gain training (a drivers license) to use larger vehicles.

The user will head to a training facility; a sandbox to practice. By passing the training a player gains license points; presentable to any one corp officer.

The user may opt never to train. If stopped by onecorp they may check - and if driving illegally, the player is killed.
