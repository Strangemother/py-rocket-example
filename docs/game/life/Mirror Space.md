Mirror Space

The "mirror space" is the same (current) universe, slid through a portal - reflecting world items in reverse.
The user will step through a portal, resulting in the same location, but mirror positions.

+ The female VO is now spanish -
+ World game scene has a colour tint (post effect)

In this mirror space; you can gain 'alterntive' hardware for your ship; essentially an anti matter state - but they may not be compatible in the normal space due to some lore problem.

To reduce the time in the mirror space, the world will drain matter from the system; because the player is within an anti-matter space.
