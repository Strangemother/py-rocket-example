# Micro events

Events to occur in-game, through action of another event; not directly aligned to the plot - more a fun addition.


## Cab car multipass

If you're driving calmly in a cab car for a few minutes doing car things, a large roof collision will occur - smashing a hole through the roof (back) of the cab. In the seat sits a "multipass". At the point of camera interest [nicole] will voice over (a best attempt immitation of) "multipass" - spoken in the same form as fifth elementh leeloo crash.


## motorway vw crab claws

If the player is within a _long stay_ motorway vehicle, and drift too low (below the fog line) snappy claws attempt to grab the vehicle.
