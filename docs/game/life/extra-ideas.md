The intention is _not_ to build an open world game, as this yields a more complex application. However it's hard to consider a game such as this, without the ability to explore areas.

Generally I feel the game may be "floating houses" and skylanes, omitting a lot of the and complexities. A user may land on any platform to explore and utilise. Some areas exist at a great distance. The player will traverse _longer travels_ at their best ability, performing ship maintenance en-route.

Platforms and mini environments - floating in the sky - will exist in the form of purpose built locations (shops, an arena some kind) and applied procedurally in a seeded location.

All platforms exist far enough for the user to use their ship. The lower level may be another environment entirely, however the first iteration will likely manifest as a "fog of death".


## cpu upgrade

a user start with 1Terahtz for the AdamFlightSystem.
When doubled (through) purchase. The audio doubled - enacting a 'voice' per CPU in sync.
When issues occur - one than one conversation persists from Xcpu devices.
A max of 4* voices then apply _base_ for more cpus.

A user should be able to determine the _power_ of the system by audio robotic voices.

## Engine coupling

During a game, the user may lose and engine through dogfighting or general damage. The engine may be attached by flying close-enough for the device to auto-connect.

Other users may do the same - augmenting engine theft. Any engine may persist on a vehicle - causing mismatches and interesting flying dynamics created by the user (scrap recycling)
