# Education and Lore

The general style of the game evokes an "atompunk" and/or "solarpunk" environment where roughly 100 years ago (now known as) 'One Corp' invented the _anti gravity_ engine - of which fundamentally replaced the wheel in modern-day society.

As such Houses, Cars and general world components hover. Much like a "jestons" age: [ships.md](ships.md) . This game is specifically focused on the vehicle mechanics, allowing a player to build upon and advance ship with their own _software_ [game-system.md](game-system.md). The game will contain many configurations of the engine layout and software platform, allowing a player to customise the game wholeheartedly.


In Game "world history", facts and stats presented as tutorials and intro screens are styled in the "\~1950's educational animation video". Presenting content such as "How does the ion engine work?" with pseudo science explaining game components.


## Animation Style

The material is presented in the atompunk style of the 1950's design. Encompassing bold lines, smooth curvey foliage, a strong quantized colour palette and a chromic futuristic overture. [styles.md](styles.md) 

The animation style will be 12FPS double framed (similar to the old-style cartoons) - with visual _grain_ applied in game (post).

## Voiceover

A male voiceover cast in the same dialect and tone as the original counterparts. The script should be written be a period writer; namely our current editor.

The tone should be flat, informative, and direct. Futhermore the educational method (at the time) focused on many cold facts including lists of people, linear date recital, or _complex terms_ mixed with somewhat simplified script narration - punctuated with animated "cards".

> Fundamentally the core voiceover _style_ evocative of the age. Notably male, American, and exceptionally clear.

The script style is conversational, first-person direct, and utilises informal colloquialisms for most sentences.
