The intention is _not_ to build an open world game, as this yields a more complex application. However it's hard to consider a game such as this, without the ability to explore areas.

Generally I feel the game may be "floating houses" and skylanes, omitting a lot of the and complexities. A user may land on any platform to explore and utilise. Some areas exist at a great distance. The player will traverse _longer travels_ at their best ability, performing ship maintenance en-route.

Platforms and mini environments - floating in the sky - will exist in the form of purpose built locations (shops, an arena some kind) and applied procedurally in a seeded location.

All platforms exist far enough for the user to use their ship. The lower level may be another environment entirely, however the first iteration will likely manifest as a "fog of death".

## In-game Adverts (Tonality)

The in-game _tone_ would focus on fun interactions with a tongue in cheek overture. As a whole the NPC's act neutral unless scripted; such as the "junkyard owner". The in-game world has _advertisements_ for upgrades and world scenes. Automatic adverts popup on a ships "externals coms panel" as audio, video, (or hologram?) auto-play whilst flying past.

It would be fun to apply a _distopian feel_ where the advert is almost nialist in a post apocalyptic manner, with a conversely happy tone,

+ "Buy Buy BUY Ship Insurance for your Ships Insurance; Garmented to Pay Pay Pay Twice!"
+ "The One Corp. We own it all - so you don't have to..."
+ "Need Lungs but don't have Respiratory Insurance Insurance? Swap your Respiratory Insurance for one other limb and get Lungs for free! ^This does not include replacement respiratory insurance or validate a new respiratory insurance insurance."
+ "Do you enjoy overindulging on One Corp One Delmot Once a Day but don't have victims? Offer available within a [states some crazy math] -RaR 1/2 Pi over 1,30 Asimuth! Or pin OCODOD on your One Device!"
+ "Bored of working 5 hours a day 4 days a week?! Become a Human Interaction Drone for less!" [Graphic of a (oddly) happy human pressing a single button for 4 hours in a 5 second timelapse]
+ "Robot Pet Surprise, for when you need an exact replacement for your depleted previous pet. ^Consciousness safely stored in the pet paradise for 6 months then kindly recycled. All proceeds are collected by the one corp."


## cpu upgrade

a user start with 1Terahtz for the AdamFlightSystem.
When doubled (through) purchase. The audio doubled - enacting a 'voice' per CPU in sync.
When issues occur - one than one conversation persists from Xcpu devices.
A max of 4* voices then apply _base_ for more cpus.

A user should be able to determine the _power_ of the system by audio robotic voices.

## Engine coupling

During a game, the user may lose and engine through dogfighting or general damage. The engine may be attached by flying close-enough for the device to auto-connect.

Other users may do the same - augmenting engine theft. Any engine may persist on a vehicle - causing mismatches and interesting flying dynamics created by the user (scrap recycling)
