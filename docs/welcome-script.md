+ Will be an automated in-game audio message
+ Jovial and welcoming (The tone your famous for)
+ minor dystopian undertone - ("one corp" own everything)
+ ending in a cheerful tone.

Extra Notes:

+ ~50 Words, ~20 seconds
+ Spoken text is the indented stuff
+ "Telomore" and "Planitia" is pronounced however you prefer
+ None of this is sacred. It's not public.


The Script:

    Welcome to The Peoples United Freedom Republic of Gecko Planitia - where peace floats with harmony.
    Please consider stopping at a One Corp biological upgrade center for your free mandated Telomere test.

[Cheerful]

    And remember! Always enjoy the everlasting homage to the great Gecko Habit of the One Corp Council Cluster.
