TL:DR;

I hope this enough the correct stuff to steer you. Personally I'd say the first track "A1 overture", is the answer to our question, and the other songs are soft arrows towards our likes.

Fundamentally we want:

+ souring in the sky trippy
+ Hopefully something to please metal fans
+ Atompunk reference - synths/funky tones/a throwback to some 50's thing.
+ It's set in a Utopia future-like https://github.com/Strangemother/py-rocket-example/blob/main/docs/styles.md

You're in charge.


# Premise

We're building a game focusing on vehicle mechanics and user customisation of their 'ship' for complex flight games (think of a flight-sim, but for imaginary machines) Set within a parallel world where _anti-gravity_ was invented in the \~1940/50s, the style will mimic the atom-punk and solar-punk design with in-game lore stylised around an era progressive of the tone.


Although the game lore originates in a past era, we're adapting the sound track for a modern game, notably 'atom punk with a metal twist' for the game overture. Whilst players fly-about, they will listen to some licensed content; likely chillout, electronic sweepy stuff.

---

Your track will be the main track, and will be utilised as the _box art_ sound and one-of the "premier" action events within the game, such as a new player and city into.

We would like a metal track evocative of the atomic age style. That's pretty much the job - we're not music engineers (mostly metal heads), so we don't know how to structure this.

From previous conversation we have:

+ About 2 minutes
+ A guitar solo
+ Metal.


I sincerely do not have the lexicon to succinctly convey myself, so please forgive me ahead of time for anything that sounds contradictory.

---

A consensus has these highlights:

+ Groove, Melodic Death Metal
+ Sweepy space age sound
+ Synths, electronic tones (beeps and stuff) is all good

We're all metal fans, so we love complex riffs and ripping solos.

I'm hoping thats a wide enough scope for you to produce whatever you want. Stay within or step away from atompunk sounds - is complete up to you. The only result we want is:

> A general milieu or atmosphere should be sweeping freedom - space age exploration - or something to evoke a utopia feel.

^ through a metal cab :D

A fun idea was to plug in the "jetsons 4 notes" somewhere - or part of the track just as iconic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swNz4_gVPb8

As that's where the game idea essentially originated. But that's not a forced point.

to define what we _don't_ like should help.

+ This "Space metal": is just a bit flat: https://open.spotify.com/album/5FJ4iBssG6V530ms8YvGIa?autoplay=true

  I think it a bit too _piss-take_ and although of the same idea, doesn't convey our preferences.

A1 S1 - The Atompunk Opera Overture

    Surprisingly this track incorporates a lot of the sounds I think we're looking for.

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAwuHvMuCSs

Atom Punk by BurningTapes - Music from The state51 Conspiracy

    Another atom-punk classic

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNXzmKLmBf4



Styx - Mr. Roboto (Official Video)

    Just the intro - but who doesn't love a bit of Styx...

    https://youtu.be/uc6f_2nPSX8


Gunship - Dark All Day

    One of the _outsiders_ for the line up of likable concepts. The track itself is identifiably cyberpunk, but is still awesome all-round.

    https://open.spotify.com/track/4GBJomKlZNRnODfpL299pw?si=f71be7fe5cec45a6

Electric Light Orchestra...

    ELO lends itself to the theme.

    ELO - Mr. Blue Sky
    ELO - Ticket to the Moon
    ELO - Telephone Line


Rishloo: Just A Ride, Landmines

    Great chillout feel, if a little too gentle for our preference.

    https://open.spotify.com/track/5j86XAMtRZk9UrpdOrHU1T?si=ebf22b0226ef460f

    Very cool, somewhat ethereal

    https://open.spotify.com/track/0nMKVMCXCmRplsKKLt1TTh?si=0451f2d61db04470


Ningen Isu / 人間椅子 / 無情のスキャット (Heartless Scat)

    Although long it has a lot of great elements.

    https://open.spotify.com/track/1H9qL5Oi0OVdE7kpMRJBwa?si=e6ae6f297c67480e


Plini: Selenium Forest

    Sexy as hell.

# Overall Composition

Stepping away from great sounds and tones, the overall feel we're happy with can range from Chill to super heavy stresses and a thick riff; but it's up to you.

Here's some more heavier tracks we enjoy, simply because we head bang too hard at them.


Deftones - Genesis
    https://open.spotify.com/track/2UTqXRGegH18sRXSuOUvFa?si=f016044211b94d65

    We're not deftones fans as a whole, however this track has a great groove-like swing, and synth-like intros.

Killswitch - My Last Serenade:

    smooth intro, "other worldly" sound

    https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ps4FrDiR6JcJfSZbXAPBz?si=210f4646d983444b



Thor's Hammer - Ethan Meixsell

    We love this and wanting to use this or similar as as part of a battle scene:

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1NNlqCjGcQ


AWOLNATION - Sails

    Of course we love this - and this rendition including more reverb would easily match the game

    https://open.spotify.com/track/5xhQChGGhKLWqBqX4XhtYE?si=ea2fcf1ec52943a7

# Progression


Alcest - Oiseaux de proie

    Very left-field and not-at-all heavy metal. But it instantly has the cloud flight vibe.

    https://open.spotify.com/track/2LqniAScDuwvOSWEHbsJAI?si=69a32f63a1db4435

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/01goDEgLNLAVOmRQ8Ip7js" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>


BucketHead - Big Sur Moon

    And Soothsayer obviously, but Big Sur Moon is lots of fun and presents the same sensation as the  _other worldly_ motion we're looking for.


Broken: Karl Casey

    https://open.spotify.com/track/6I0XRdJO3uJqq5kfjihLYi?si=fd5a24b68a1e41e9

    We really like this, and it applies a lot of what we're looking for:

    + Lovely Heavy Metal
    + Strong stresses
    + great progression


Routa, Pt2: Wolfheart

    https://open.spotify.com/track/1EKwGnCjmmHuL6ItMDQcE4?si=7612e5cf66de44f4

    Another classic with a great range of gentle and heavy drops. It has some of the switches we could consider.

    + Heavy Drops

    Dislikes:

    + The guitar elements aren't clear and distinct


Concerto's Lair: C-137

    https://open.spotify.com/track/1EHP750eeC8cI7F3Kukm4u?si=72732faf5bc14ef2

In other more gentle areas of the game, we have license to use Burnwater music: https://soundcloud.com/burnwater. Indeed this is very apart from both the atom-punk and metal feel - but that's cool, we intend to switch it up.


And that's it! :P

I hope that's enough to steer you. Personally I'd say the first track "A1 overture", is the answer to our question, and the other songs are soft arrows towards our likes.

Fundamentally we want:

+ souring in the sky trippy
+ Hopefully something to please metal fans
+ It's set in a Utopia future-like https://github.com/Strangemother/py-rocket-example/blob/main/docs/styles.md

Thank you in advance.
