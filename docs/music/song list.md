A1 S1 - The Atompunk Opera Overture

    Surprisingly this track incorporates a lot of the sounds I think we're looking for.

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAwuHvMuCSs

Atom Punk by BurningTapes - Music from The state51 Conspiracy

    Another atom-punk classic

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNXzmKLmBf4



Styx - Mr. Roboto (Official Video)

    Just the intro - but who doesn't love a bit of Styx...

Gunship - Dark All Day

    One of the _outsiders_ for the line up of likable concepts. The track itself is identifiably cyberpunk, but is still awesome all-round.

Electric Light Orchestra...

    ELO lends itself to the theme.

    ELO - Mr. Blue Sky
    ELO - Ticket to the Moon
    ELO - Telephone Line


Rishloo: Just A Ride, Landmines

    Great chillout feel, if a little too gentle for our preference.

    https://open.spotify.com/track/5j86XAMtRZk9UrpdOrHU1T?si=ebf22b0226ef460f

    Very cool, somewhat ethereal

Ningen Isu / 人間椅子 / 無情のスキャット (Heartless Scat)

    Although long it has a lot of great elements.

Plini: Selenium Forest

    Sexy as hell.

# Overall Composition

Stepping away from great sounds and tones, the overall feel we're happy with can range from Chill to super heavy stresses and a thick riff; but it's up to you.

Here's some more heavier tracks we enjoy, simply because we head bang too hard at them.


Deftones - Genesis
    https://open.spotify.com/track/2UTqXRGegH18sRXSuOUvFa?si=f016044211b94d65

    We're not deftones fans as a whole, however this track has a great groove-like swing, and synth-like intros.

Killswitch - My Last Serenade:

    smooth intro, "other worldly" sound

    https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ps4FrDiR6JcJfSZbXAPBz?si=210f4646d983444b



Thor's Hammer - Ethan Meixsell

    We love this and wanting to use this or similar as as part of a battle scene:

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1NNlqCjGcQ


AWOLNATION - Sails

    Of course we love this - and this rendition including more reverb would easily match the game

# Progression


Alcest - Oiseaux de proie

    Very left-field and not-at-all heavy metal. But it instantly has the cloud flight vibe.

    https://open.spotify.com/track/2LqniAScDuwvOSWEHbsJAI?si=69a32f63a1db4435


BucketHead - Big Sur Moon

    And Soothsayer obviously, but Big Sur Moon is lots of fun and presents the same sensation as the  _other worldly_ motion we're looking for.


Broken: Karl Casey

    https://open.spotify.com/track/6I0XRdJO3uJqq5kfjihLYi?si=fd5a24b68a1e41e9

    We really like this, and it applies a lot of what we're looking for:

    + Lovely Heavy Metal
    + Strong stresses
    + great progression


Routa, Pt2: Wolfheart

    https://open.spotify.com/track/1EKwGnCjmmHuL6ItMDQcE4?si=7612e5cf66de44f4

    Another classic with a great range of gentle and heavy drops. It has some of the switches we could consider.

    + Heavy Drops

    Dislikes:

    + The guitar elements aren't clear and distinct


Concerto's Lair: C-137

    https://open.spotify.com/track/1EHP750eeC8cI7F3Kukm4u?si=72732faf5bc14ef2

In other more gentle areas of the game, we have license to use Burnwater music: https://soundcloud.com/burnwater. Indeed this is very apart from both the atom-punk and metal feel - but that's cool, we intend to switch it up.


And that's it! :P
