
## The junkyard

A fun advantage of a plug-in base flight system will be the salvage site for ship components and other discoveries. A player can visit a junk yard (or a certified mechanic) to source ship components. A player should pay for the items through in-game earnings.

You can consider the junkyard as a scrappy hodge-podge of (galaxy?) ship bits. Imagine the junkyards of Rick and morty.

## Electrical System:

Some set rules to apply as game logic.

+ All game entities have a resistance and capacitance; everything can accept electric charge and essentially be _used_ as a component (e.g. wire.)
+ Units should maintain a preferred amp, and allow a certain throughout
+ Excess energy emits as heat
+ All items melt or explode



## Mechanic and Shipyard

Altering the ship is a core component of the game. In addition all items in a players ship is subject to damage and has a shelf life. A player aim to fix the situation

+ Buying new replacements: e.g: new battery
+ _steal items_ from a world; such as a ion booster from another (NPC) player
+ Fix, Hack, or patch the unit; such as a broken button can be bypassed.
+ Ignored; and the player can "software code" a fix or live with the problem.


A player may own a ship yard and repair service to fix the problems within a a ship. Another user may supply their ship to repair - for a fee.
The "keys" are given to the mechanic for a designated time and the (human) user corrects issues.

If the mechanic attempts to steal components (or the ship) a user may send the 'sheriff' to relinquish ownership of the ship + a small fee. The user pays a small fee and the mechanic is fined.
