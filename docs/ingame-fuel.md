Different methods of energy (fuel) represented in-game as lore assets.

## A Battery

The standard two terminal battery charge holdine a limited coumbles of electrons, released when the two terminals may flow charge.


## Bagged Hydrogen Pellet

A single hydrogen pellet as a calayst to a nuclear fusion drive can be initialized through a high temperture fusion event. A fusion reactor with lasers or a high temperture catalyst to blast the pellet until it explodes. This should occure within plasma safe reaction container.

The "Pellet bag" is an (essentially) indestructable container wrapping the hydrogen pellet with the ability to withstand the high temperture nuclear reaction within. To ignite the pellet within the bag, heat the entire package to produce fusion, the bag will rapidily expand at the point of ignition - to the size of a hydrogen fusion reactor container.
