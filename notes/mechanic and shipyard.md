A player may own a ship yard and repair service to fix the problems within a a ship. Another user may supply their ship to repair - for a fee.
The "keys" are given to the mechanic for a designated time and the (human) user corrects issues.

If the mechanic attempts to steal components (or the ship) a user may send the 'sherrif' to reliquish ownership of the ship + a small fee. The user pays a small fee and the mechanic is fined.
