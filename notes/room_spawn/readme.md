Some ideas to generate rooms within a spaceship (bunk rooms mostly), using a method of sudo random seeding and rule based generation.

Required elements:

+ Bed or many bunks
    + one centre bed
    + many 'builtin' beds
+ Desk and tables
    + night stands, lamps
    + study desk
+ windows and building greebles
+ bathroon, cupboards
+ Personal units: TVs, clothing

Essentially all the content of a bedroom, generated through rules.
