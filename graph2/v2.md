improvement over v1.

A graph and data are separate. When calling a node from the grade, it returns the
stored key, not a graph node.

The Tree allows key assignments and Graph Walkers to access the node tree

When connecting nodes, they return Pointers of which act like standard int pointers,
but provide internal relationship context during iteration.

A Graph unit acts more like a dict, accessing flat key values.

```py
graph[key] = value
pointer = Pointer(graph.get_id('other'))
graph.connect(pointer, key) # forward and reverse.
```

`graph.row` to gather a walk of nodes for a indexed path
```py
g.add(*'ABCD')
g.add(*'CDEF')
g.add(*'DT')
g.resolve(fill=EMPTY) #default
# (A,B,C,D,),
# (C,D,E,F),
# (D,T),
g.row(2)
(A, B,C,D,T)
```

Walk merges bind paths into distinct walks

```
   path(0, 0, [1,1], 0,     1)
 + path(0, 0, 0,     1,     1, 1)
==      0, 0, [0,1], [0,1], 1, 1
```

# Edges

Each node to node connection may bind through an "edge". The connection provides
additional information through the connection. For example with a node of two
`int` types, the edge may multiply through transaction.

A connection without an edge will attain the default connection of _no edge connection_
or simply a nully step to the next node.

```py

class Multiply(Edge):

    def forward(a, b):
        """Return the value Node(B) will accept within its forward(a,b)
        value. the var `a` for the next call is this returned value.
        """
        return a * 2

g.connect(1,2,3,4) # no edge
(1,2,3,4)

g.connect(1,2,3,4, edge=Multiply)
# (1*2), (2*2), (3*2), (4*2)
(2, 4, 6, 8,)

```

# Paths

A Path defines a linear walk through the graph, from a start to finish node.
The path is a list of positions for each node step through edges.

```py
path = [0,0,0,0,1,0,2,1,2,0]
graph.walk_path(path, start='A')
['A','B', 'C', 'D', 1, 'E', 10, 2, 20, 0]
```

```py
g.add(*'ABCD')
g.add(*'CDEF')
g.add(*'DT')
g.resolve(fill=EMPTY) #default
(A,B,C,D,),
(C,D,E,F),
(D,T),

g.resolve(fill=CLONE)

('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', ' ',),
('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F',),
('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'T',),

g.resolve(fill='+')

('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', '+', '+',)
('+', '+', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F',)
('+', '+', 'C', 'D', 'T', '+',)

g.resolve(rfill='X', lfill='_')

('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'X', 'X',)
('_', '_', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F',)
('_', '_', 'C', 'D', 'T', 'X',)

```

# Tree Vs unpacked content

When working with the graph, you may only be interested in one sub utility, such as your values, the edges, or the real graph nodes. Through the main `graph` interface, the units resolve to the graph values, such as the `ABCD` values. Using the `graph.tree` allows access to the `GraphNode` and its `Edge` connections.
