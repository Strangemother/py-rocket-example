
Some set rules to apply as game logic.

+ Volts emit at a constant value.
+ Units maintain a preferred voltage
+ Amps is the max of the power chain (e.g a 3amp led)
+ Units should maintain a preferred amp, and allow a certain throughout
+ Excess energy emits as heat
+ All items melt or explode

+ A unit connected in a power chain, may only communicate through the chain
+ Unless it's a wireless device

+ All game entities have a resisance and capacitance; everything can accept electric charge and essentially be _used_ as a component (e.g. wire.)
