# Sequences

Each input may step the sequences, the resulting table reads valid sequences.

Step one handles inputs.

Although cheap The sequences input machine is versatile:

+ Game 'cheat' input
+ Sequence testing

For the game ship, input sequences are checked (after applied to the sequence machine) - processing internal steps unitl success. If a key fails during startup - the associated units react though events from the sequence machine. Essentially graph-based step-testing.

As input sequences may overlap, unique sub-sequences may be captured whilst capturing large sequences: considering the keys:

    load
    systemlive
    systemliveload
    live
    loadpass
    loadfail
    fail
    pass

A 5 key even stream may activate all:

    start system live load pass
